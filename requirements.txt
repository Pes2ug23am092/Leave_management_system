# requirements.txt
#
# Note: This repository is a Node.js + React project (not Python).
# There are no Python packages required to run the app.
#
# Dependencies are managed via npm and listed in:
#   - backend/package.json
#   - frontend/package.json
#
# If your deployment platform requires a requirements.txt file,
# you can keep this file as-is (empty of pip-installable packages).
#
# Environment Tooling Versions:
#   Node.js: >= 18
#   npm: >= 9
#   MySQL Server: 8.x (or MariaDB equivalent)
#
# For Python-based tooling (if introduced later), list packages below,
# one per line (e.g., black, flake8, pytest, etc.).
#
# This file exists for deployment compatibility only — no pip packages required.
